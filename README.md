## About

These notes go along with the [Build an Angular Instant Search Component](https://egghead.io/courses/build-an-angular-instant-search-component) collection from [Christoph Burgdorf](https://egghead.io/instructors/christoph-burgdorf)

In this course, we use [Angular](https://angular.io/) and the [Wikipedia API](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php) to create a search component that displays Wikipedia articles related to a search input. Through these lessons, the viewer can expect to learn and apply
- Observables in Angular
- Operators
- RxJS

The code used in the course is of Angular ^2.0.0, and the code given in the [transcript](https://codesandbox.io/s/54xv161qq4?from-embed) is of Angular 7.0.3. **An updated version of the code can be found [here](https://github.com/ParkerGits/build-an-angular-instant-search-component)** *(updated 5/8/2020)*. The code for each lesson resides in the respective branch on the repository.
